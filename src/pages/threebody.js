/**
 * Calculating simple circular orbits
 *
 * I need a way to calculate where the spheres travel over time.
 * We only have differential equations that describe each sphere motion, since there
 * isn't a closed solution for the three-body problem.
 *
 * To start, I'm going to try to animate the sphere to travel in a circular orbit around the screen.
 *
 * One way to do this is to use the parametric representation of a circle:
 *
 * x = cos(t)
 * y = sin(t)
 *
 * These two equations trace a circle as your vary t.
 *
 * Put these equations into https://www.desmos.com/calculator to see them in action.
 *
 * Two body system (https://towardsdatascience.com/modelling-the-three-body-problem-in-classical-mechanics-using-python-9dc270ad7767)
 *
 * Newton's Law of Gravitation: F = ((G * m1 * m2) / r^2) * r
 * where G is the universal gravitational constant: 6.67408 Ã— 10-11 m3 kg-1 s-2;
 * r^2 is the distance between the two bodies;
 * and r is a unit vector that points away from the body m1 towards m2.
 *
 * To get the acceleration of one of the bodies, we can plug that equation in to
 * Newton's second law of motion: F = ma and solve for a:
 *
 * ((G * m1 * m2) / r^2) * r = m1 * a
 *
 * a can also be re-written as: a = d^2r / dt^2 (second deriv. of the position vector, r, w.r.t to time.) so we're left
 * with (flipped left and right side, too):
 *
 * m1 * d^2r / dt^2 = ((G * m1 * m2) / r^2) * r
 *
 * unpacking the unit vector, r, gives us:
 *
 * m1 * d^2r / dt^2 = ((G * m1 * m2) / r^3) * r12
 *
 * We now have a second-order differential equation to describe the acceleration of the bodies due to gravity.
 *
 * Further break it down into two first-order differential equations, to make it easier to work with:
 * Note: this equation applies to both bodies so we index it with i to make it generic.
 *
 * Substituting a = d^2r / dt^2 = dv / dt = v (a is just change in velocity over time)
 * and v = dr/dt gives us two new first-order differential equations:
 *
 * one that describes the change in velocity in terms of position and mass:
 * m_i * dv_i / dt = ((G * m_i * m_j) / r_ij^3) * r_ij
 *
 * and one that describes the change in position in terms of velocity:
 * dr/dt = v_i
 *
 * given initial position and velocity vectors for the two bodies, we can calculate their change in velocities at
 * each time step, use that to calculate their instantaneous velocity (add that to their previous velocities) and then since
 * velocity is just change in position over time, add that to the current position vector to get the next one.
 *
 * Before integrating these equations, first non-dimensionalize them. We convert all quantities that have dimensions (e.g. m/s, kg, etc.)
 * into ones that don't have dimensional quantities by dividing them by some reference value with the same dimension. This helps
 * scale quantities to make our numerical methods converge faster and make calculations computationally cheaper since all values
 * will be relatively close to 1. Also gives a reference point for scale. Everything is described wrt to the reference quantities
 * (e.g 2x the reference quantity).
 *
 * Divide both sides by a fixed reference quantity. Can lump this amount into a constant K:
 *
 * leaves us with:
 * m_i * dv_i / dt = K_1 * ((m_i * m_j) / r_ij ^ 3) * r_ij
 * dr_i / dt = K_2 * v_i
