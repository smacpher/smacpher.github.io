                <h3>January 2023 to June 2024 | Snowflake</h3>
                <p>After Myst was acquired, I spent a year and a half working to improve Snowflake's
                    <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-ai-features">machine learning
                        capabilities</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my first few weeks, I collaborated with the team to share our expertise in
                    developing production machine learning systems. This involved sharing knowledge about our
                    APIs, time series database, model training and inference platform, and hyperparameter tuning
                    services.
                </p>
                <p> I then worked on a nimble team to design and implement Snowflake's first semantic search
                    functionalities. We shipped early access support for built-in vector distance functions, created
                    services for approximate vector search and text embedding generation, and contributed to <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SQXxxKRRFU">Frosty</a>, an
                    LLM-powered chatbot built for Snowflake. These efforts helped pave the way for native <a

                        types</a>, <a
                        href="https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/vector-embeddings">embedding
                        generation</a>, and <a
                        href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/vector-embeddings#vector-similarity-search">search</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Motivated by a desire to learn more about performant and secure systems programming, I transitioned
                    to the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowpark/">Snowpark</a> Execution
                    Environment
                    team. This team was responsible for the platform that powered many machine learning features
                    like <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/overview">Snowflake ML</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-ml-functions">ML Functions</a>. I
                    focused on
                    optimizing Python environment creation for interactive workloads like <a

                <h3>September 2018 to January 2023 | Myst AI (acquired by Snowflake)</h3>
                <p>In September 2018, I joined Myst as the founding engineer. Over the next four and a half years, I
                    sharpened my
                    software engineering and machine learning skills, and learned how to build products and grow a
                    team.</p>
                <p>
                    I worked on all parts of our technical stack. Some of the projects the team shipped that I'm most

                <p>
                    In addition to my technical work, I contributed to our culture, engineering roadmaps and
                    processes,
                    hiring,
                    mentorship, and team-building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also did some apprenticeships with coworkers to round out my data science and business
                    development
                    skills and learn how other parts of the business functioned. There was no shortage of work to be
                    done at Myst so I tried to contribute where I could.</p>

                <h3>August 2015 to September 2018 | Undergrad & Internships</h3>
                <p>I took a non-traditional path through my undergraduate studies that gave me a wide range of academic
                    experiences. I started at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> studying
                    Biomedical Engineering, attended a
                    community college in the Bay Area, and then transferred to <a href="https://www.pomona.edu">Pomona
                        College</a> where I studied Computer
                    Science and Cognitive Science & Linguistics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I played Division III soccer for Carnegie Mellon and Pomona, which took most of my time during the
                    fall semesters. During community college, I was a math tutor, member of student government, and
                    hosted a podcast for the school newspaper. At Pomona, I was an associate at <a
                        href="https://www.pomonaventures.com">Pomona Ventures</a>, a
                    student-run entrepreneurship club, helped organize the 5C Hackathon, and did <a

                        research</a> with
                    a professor.

                <p>
                    In the summer after my freshman year, I interned at <a
                        href="https://store.google.com/us/category/connected_home">Google Nest</a>. I worked with one of
                    the future Myst
                    co-founders to build an ETL framework with <a href="https://airflow.apache.org">Airflow</a>,
                    <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/dataflow">Dataflow</a>, and <a
                        href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> to evaluate the
                    performance of the Nest <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9257400">Home/Away
                        Assist</a> algorithm across devices in the wild. Eventually, the framework was adopted by
                    multiple
                    teams
                    to scale their data pipelines.

                <p>
                    In the summer after my sophomore year, I backpacked with friends through South East Asia.

                    In the summer after my junior year, I returned to Google Nest, and worked on a simulator to test
